<h3>The types of  weiners dogs</h3>
<p>There are very many different breeds of weiner dogs. They vary from the wire-haired Daschund all the way to the miniture daschund. (Dashund is their real name)
My favorite type od weiner dog breed is the smooth-haired Daschund. They do not shed a lot and they are smooth to pet. They are just so cute </p>daschund.
